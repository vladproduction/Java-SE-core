        Explanation

    Core Components structure:
    ==========================

 1) Interfaces:
 - Vehicle.java: Defines common operations all vehicles must support (start, stop, accelerate, brake)
 - MaintenanceSystem.java: Defines common maintenance operations (routine checks, repairs)

 2) Concrete Implementations:
 - Three different vehicle types: Car, Motorcycle, and Truck
 - Three different maintenance system types, each matching a vehicle type

 3) Demo Application:
 - VehicleManagementApp.java: Demonstrates how to use abstraction to work with different implementations through common interfaces

    Key Abstraction Concepts Demonstrated:
    ======================================

 1) Interface as a Contract:
 - The Vehicle and MaintenanceSystem interfaces define what operations are available without specifying how they're implemented.

 2) Implementation Hiding:
 - A car starts differently than a motorcycle (motorcycle needs stand retracted)
 - A truck speeds up differently based on cargo weight
 - Different maintenance systems have different check intervals and procedures

 3) Polymorphism through Abstraction:
 - The operateVehicles() method works with any Vehicle without knowing its specific type
 - The performMaintenance() method works with any MaintenanceSystem without knowing its specific type

 4) Interface vs. Implementation:
 - All vehicles provide the same method signatures but implement them differently
 - Each vehicle has additional specific functionality (e.g., car's AC control, motorcycle's wheelie, truck's cargo loading)

    Benefits Shown in the Example:
    ==============================

 1) Simplified Programming:
 We can work with collections of different vehicles through a common interface
 Code can be written once to handle multiple vehicle types

 2) Extensibility:
 New vehicle types can be added without changing existing code
 The system is open for extension but closed for modification (Open/Closed Principle)

 3) Code Organization:
 Clear separation between what an object does vs. how it does it
 Improved maintainability and readability

    Access Modifiers:
    =================

 The example also demonstrates different Java access modifiers:
  - public: Interface methods and main class implementations
  - private: Internal implementation details in classes
  - Default/package-private: Implicitly used in some class members


    Running the Example:
    ====================

When you run the VehicleManagementApp, it will:

1) Create different vehicle and maintenance system instances
2) Demonstrate using them through the abstract interfaces
3) Show specific features of each concrete implementation
4) Simulate a road trip to show the practical benefits of abstraction

This example provides a concrete and practical way to understand how abstraction is implemented in Java
and why it's beneficial for building maintainable, flexible software systems.

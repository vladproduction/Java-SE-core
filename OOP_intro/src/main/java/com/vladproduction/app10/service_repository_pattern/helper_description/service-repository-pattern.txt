Design Patterns & Concepts Demonstrated in this program example:

1) Repository Pattern: Cleanly separates data access logic from business logic
 * Generic Repository<T, ID> interface with type parameters for entity and ID types
 * Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

2) Service Layer Pattern: Encapsulates business logic
 * UserService<T, ID> provides business operations like filtering by age
 * Validates business rules before delegating to repositories

3) Dependency Injection:
 * Services receive repositories through constructor injection
 * Makes code more testable and flexible

4) Inheritance & Polymorphism:
 * Abstract User base class with specific implementations
 * Repository implementations for different database types
 * Common interface allows for polymorphic usage

5) Generics:
 * Used throughout to provide type safety while allowing flexibility
 * Better handling of different user types and ID types

6) Java 8 Features:
 * Stream API for filtering collections
 * Optional for safer null handling
 * Method references for cleaner code

7) Database Abstraction:
 * MongoDB and MySQL implementations with technology-specific methods
 * Common interface for consistent interaction regardless of database type

*************************************

Approaches used

1) Structure:
 * Proper package organization (domain, repository, service)
 * Separation of concerns between layers

2) Extended Functionality:
 * Complete CRUD operations, not just create and read
 * Type-specific methods for each database implementation
 * Better error handling with exceptions and Optional

3) Realistic Implementation:
 * Simulates database interactions more accurately
 * Uses maps to represent database tables/collections

4) Comprehensive Documentation:
 * Detailed JavaDoc comments explaining concepts and operations
 * Well-commented Main class demonstrating usage

5) Modern Java Practices:
 * Follows Java best practices and conventions
 * Uses latest Java features appropriately

*************************************

Workflow Demonstration in two complete ways:

1) MongoDB Workflow:
 * Creates a MongoDB repository
 * Injects it into a compatible service
 * Registers MongoDB users
 * Performs queries, filtering, and MongoDB-specific operations

2) MySQL Workflow:
 * Same operations but with MySQL-specific implementations
 * Shows how the same service interface works with different database types

        Summary:
 - Real-world enterprise Java applications handle database abstraction, service layers, and dependency injection.
 - It demonstrates the proper use of inheritance, generics, and modern Java features to create a flexible, maintainable codebase.
 - The design allows for easy extension to support additional database types or user classes without modifying existing code,
   following the Open/Closed Principle from SOLID design principles.

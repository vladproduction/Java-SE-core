It tells your program to execute a certain section of code
only if a particular test evaluates to true.
void stopCar() {
 // the "if" clause: car must be stopped
 if (isMoving) {
 // the "then" clause must stop car
 isMoving = false;
 }
}
The opening and closing braces are optional, provided
that the "then" clause contains only one statement:
 void stopCar() {
 // same as above, but without braces
 if (isMoving)
 isMoving = false;
 }

 Provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause
 evaluates to false.
 void stopCar() {
 if (isMoving) {
  isMoving = false;
 } else {
  System.err.println("The car has already stopped!");
 }
 }

/**
 * Compilation:
 * When you assign new Dog() to Animal myDog, the Java compiler verifies that Dog is a subclass of Animal.
 * This assignment is valid, and myDog holds a reference to a Dog object while the reference type is Animal.
 *
 * Method Invocation:
 * When myDog.makeSound() is called, the JVM checks the actual objectâ€™s class (the object type is Dog)
 *  and invokes the overridden makeSound() method from the Dog class, resulting in "Bark".
 *
 * Invalid Assignment Example:
 * If we attempt to assign a String to an Animal reference (as commented out),
 *  the Java compiler catches this during compile time, preventing invalid assignments.
 *
 * Runtime Checks:
 * When you try to cast an Animal reference to a Dog reference with Dog wrongDog = (Dog) myAnimal, the JVM performs a type check at runtime.
 * Since myAnimal is of type Animal and not Dog, this results in a ClassCastException.

First, you need to describe the following classes:
Coord2 – a point in two-dimensional space
Coord3, which is a point in three-dimensional space and a descendant of the Coord2 class
Coord4 – a point in four-dimensional space, a descendant of the Coord3 class
CoordM – a space (described as an array of points).
The parameter type of this class is set to an upper limit of type Coord2 – this means that the array type is limited to type Coord2 and its descendant.

It is necessary to describe the Main class, which will implement the showXY() method to display any space on the plane:
the method must accept spaces of any dimension, so its parameter type must be CoordM<?>.

It is necessary to implement the showXYZ() method to display three-dimensional spaces: the method must accept spaces with at least three coordinates,
so its parameter type must be restricted to the upper bound of Coord3 to avoid mistakenly passing a two-dimensional space.

It is necessary to implement the showAll() method to display a space with all known dimensions: the method must accept spaces with at least four coordinates,
so its parameter type must be constrained by the upper bound Coord4.

You should create a two-dimensional space ss based on an array of points of type Coord2 and try to display it by calling the showXY()
and showXYZ() methods. In this case, there will be a compilation error, since the method is unable to accept two-dimensional spaces.
You should create a four-dimensional space cc based on an array of points of type Coord4 and try to display it by calling the showXY(),
showXYZ() and showAll() methods. All methods are executed without errors.

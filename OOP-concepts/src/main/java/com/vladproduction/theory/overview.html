<h1>Overview of Programming Packages</h1>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Abstraction Package</h2>
  <p>Demonstrates abstraction through an abstract Vehicle class with abstract and concrete methods.</p>
  <p>Shows interface implementation with ElectricVehicle.</p>
  <p>Provides a concrete implementation with ElectricCar.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Encapsulation Package</h2>
  <p>Features a BankAccount class that hides data using private fields.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates controlled access through public methods.</p>
  <p>Shows data protection with PIN verification.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Inheritance Package</h2>
  <p>Contains a base Employee class and derived classes Manager and Developer.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates method overriding and extending functionality.</p>
  <p>Shows how to access parent class methods using super.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Polymorphism Package</h2>
  <p>Illustrates runtime polymorphism with shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle).</p>
  <p>Shows compile-time polymorphism with method overloading in the Calculator class.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates using the same interface for different implementations.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Composition Package</h2>
  <p>Models a Car class composed of Engine, Wheels, and MusicSystem components.</p>
  <p>Shows strong "has-a" relationships where component lifecycles are tied to the composite object.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates how composition provides greater flexibility than inheritance.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Aggregation Package</h2>
  <p>Creates University, Department, Professor, and Student classes.</p>
  <p>Shows "has-a" relationships where components can exist independently.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates how objects can be shared among different aggregating objects.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Association Package</h2>
  <p>Shows different types of associations: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.</p>
  <p>Implements bidirectional relationships between classes.</p>
  <p>Displays how objects relate to each other without ownership.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Cohesion Package</h2>
  <p>Contrasts a low-cohesion class that does many unrelated things.</p>
  <p>Provides high-cohesion alternatives with focused responsibilities.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates the benefits of the single-responsibility principle.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Coupling Package</h2>
  <p>Compares tightly-coupled classes directly dependent on implementations.</p>
  <p>Shows loosely-coupled alternatives using interfaces and dependency injection.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates how loose coupling improves flexibility and maintainability.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Delegation Package</h2>
  <p>Implements a PrinterController that delegates printing to different printer types.</p>
  <p>Shows how to change behavior at runtime by switching delegate objects.</p>
  <p>Demonstrates delegation as an alternative to inheritance.</p>
</div>

<div class="package">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Each package includes a demo class with a main method that shows the concept in action with practical examples. The code is well-commented to explain key points throughout. This structured approach helps in understanding fundamental programming concepts and design principles effectively.</p>

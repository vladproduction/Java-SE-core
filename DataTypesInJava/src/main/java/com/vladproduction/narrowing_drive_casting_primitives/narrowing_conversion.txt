Narrowing conversion occurs when you convert a larger primitive data type to a smaller one.
This often involves losing some information due to the reduced size of the target type.
For example:
    Converting int to short, byte, or char.
    Converting long to int, short, or byte.
    Converting float to int, short, or byte.
    Converting double to float, int, short, or byte.

When performing these conversions, the following can happen:
* Loss of Value: The integer may exceed the range of the target type, leading to an incorrect representation.
    For example, converting 300 into byte results in 44.

* Changing Sign: If the number is negative or if the bit pattern wraps around during conversion, the sign of the result can change.
    For instance, converting -130 into byte yields -126.

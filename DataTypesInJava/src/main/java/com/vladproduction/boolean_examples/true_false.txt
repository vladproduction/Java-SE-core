Comparison operators produce a boolean result;
They evaluate relationships between values and operands;
Expression is true if expression is true;
Expression is false if expression is false;
Relational expressions are:
    * less than (<),
    * greater than (>),
    * less than or equal to (<=),
    * greater than or equal to (>=),
    * equal to (==),
    * not equal to (!=).
Equal to and not equal to work with all built-in data types, but other comparisons only work with boolean.

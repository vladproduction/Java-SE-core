Equality and Relational Operators
The equality and relational operators determine if one
operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal
to another operand.
== equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
>= greater than or equal to
< less than
<= less than or equal to

Conditionals Operators
The && and || operators perform Conditional-AND and
Conditional-OR operations on two boolean expressions.
These operators exhibit "short-circuiting" behavior, which
means that the second operand is evaluated only if
needed.
&& Conditional-AND
|| Conditional-OR

If you want to evaluate each member of expression you
should use:
& Conditional-AND
| Conditional-OR
You should be carefully because if your logic is
expecting to stop in an validation a nullPointerException
could be reached.

Another conditional operator is ?:,
Is a shorthand for an if-then-else statement.
This operator is also known as the ternary operator. You
have in a single line all functionality of a if-then-else
statement.

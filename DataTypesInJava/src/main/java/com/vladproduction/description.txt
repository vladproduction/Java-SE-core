In Java, a data type is a classification of data that specifies the type of values
that a variable can hold. It defines the operations that can be done on the data and the
memory size occupied by the data. Java supports two categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types: These are the basic building blocks of data in Java. They represent
simple values and include:

Numeric types: byte, short, int, long, float, double
Character type: char
Boolean type: boolean
Primitive data types are stored directly in the computer's memory and have predefined ranges and sizes.

Reference Data Types: These are derived from predefined classes or defined by the programmer.
They are more complex and can hold references to objects. Reference data types include:

Classes
Interfaces
Arrays
Reference data types are stored as references to objects in memory and have no fixed size.

Java also provides type inference with the introduction of the var keyword in Java 10,
which allows the compiler to infer the type of a variable based on its assigned value.
This is used for local variables only and not for method signatures or class members.

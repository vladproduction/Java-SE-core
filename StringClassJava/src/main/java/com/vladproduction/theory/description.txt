String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters.
The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.
In Java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.

How to create a string object?
There are two ways to create String object:
By string literal
By new keyword

“==” operator does not determine whether or not two strings
are identical: this operator only determines if two variables are referencing the same memory
location. The equals() method will compare the content of two strings whereas == operator
matches the object or reference of the strings.
in Java the “==” only compares the two references (not the values) of two
strings.

The Java String class supports a plethora of useful and intuitively named methods for
string-related operations, including: compare(), compareTo(), concat(), equals(),
intern(), length(), replace(), split(), and substring().
• substring(idx1, idx2): the substring from index idx1 to idx2
• compareTo(str): compare a string to a given string
• indexOfStr(str): find the index of a string in another string
• lastIndexOfStr(str): find the index of the last occurrence of a string in another string

substring example:
*the uppercase version of the first letter of the current word, concatenated with the remaining
letters of the current word, as shown here:
element = word.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() + word.substring(1); test-->Test

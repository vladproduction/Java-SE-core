Late Binding Example

The example describes three classes: Figure (as a superclass), Rectangle, and Triangle (as subclasses).

The Figure class describes two fields for storing the dimensions of figures (dim1 and dim2),
and also defines a method for calculating the area of a figure, area().
The shape of the figure is unknown for the Figure class, so this method returns 0.

The Rectangle and Triangle subclasses override the area() method to calculate their area.
The constructors of these classes pass their dimensions for storage in the dim1 and dim2 fields:
Rectangle — width and height, Triangle — base length and height.

The FindAreas class creates three objects. One each for the Figure, Rectangle, and Triangle classes.
It also creates a Figure reference — figref. This reference is in turn bound to the created objects,
and the area() method is called on it.

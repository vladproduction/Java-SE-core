    /*Default Initialization:

    In Java, when an object is created, the instance variables of that object are initialized with their specified initial values.
    If no specific constructor is defined, it uses the class-level variable initializations.
    Since courseName is defined with a default value of "Java",
    both instances will contain this value unless changed explicitly afterward (as done for courses[0]).*/

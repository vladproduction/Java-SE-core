//NOTE:
//Why This is Not LSP?

/*1) Static Methods: Static methods do not participate in polymorphism in Java.
When you call a static method, the method is resolved at compile time based on the reference type, not the object type.
This is why superRef.staticMethod() calls the method from SuperClass rather than SubClass.*/

/*2)Principle Violation: If the behavior of SuperClass and SubClass results in different outcomes based on which class
the reference type belongs to (which is the case here with static methods),
it can indicate a violation of LSP. In a properly designed subclass that adheres to LSP, you would expect that using a SubClass instance
instead of a SuperClass instance wouldnâ€™t change the expected behavior.*/

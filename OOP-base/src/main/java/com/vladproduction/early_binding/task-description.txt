The example describes:

superclass Insurance that defines:
a static field LOW
a static method getCategory() that returns the name of the superclass
a instance method getPremium() that returns the value of the field LOW.

The CarInsurance class is a subclass of Insurance that defines:
its static field HIGH
a static method getCategory() that returns the name of the subclass
a instance method getPremium() that returns the value of the field HIGH.

The Main class creates a reference to the superclass current and initializes it with an object of the subclass.
Then, the static method getCategory() is called using the reference to the object and the name of the subclass.
